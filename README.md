# Driverless EV Project

This repository hosts the source code, designs, and documentation for the **Driverless Electric Vehicle (EV) Project**, maintained by collaborators from the **Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Madras**.  
The project integrates advanced perception, planning, and control modules with sustainable electric vehicle technology to build a fully autonomous mobility platform.

## Project Overview
The Driverless EV Project aims to:
- Develop an **autonomous electric vehicle** platform for research and education.  
- Integrate **vision, sensor fusion, planning, and control** algorithms.  
- Explore **energy-efficient drive systems** for sustainable mobility.  
- Provide an **open research platform** for students and collaborators.
